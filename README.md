# Verilog-RTL
collection of synthesis-ready Verilog RTL designs focusing on FSM-based architectures, datapath–controller partitioning, and low-power digital design. The projects follow industry-standard RTL coding practices and are verified through functional simulation, aligning with ASIC and SoC design workflows.
